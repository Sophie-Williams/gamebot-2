## Games
The game bot can play the following games:

### Hide and Seek
In this game, the bot will "hide" in a random room they are present in. Players then need to join the room (if they are not already in it) and say the bot's name. If they guess right before anyone else they win the round.

#### How To Play
- To start the game use the command `@botname play Hide and Seek`
- The bot will then announce the game has started
- Any player is free to find the bot by saying its name in a channel
- A player finds the bot if they are the first to say its name in the correct channel
- The player with the most "finds" at then end of the rounds wins!

### Hot or Cold
In this game, the bot will pick a random number between 1 and 100. Users then try to guess the game and the bot will give them hints based on how close they are.

#### How To Play
- To start the game use the command `@botname play Hot or Cold`
- The bot will then announce the game has started
- Any player is free to guess a number by entering it into the channel
- The player who correctly guesses the number wins!

### Longest Word
In this game, the bot will pick a random letter. Users then try to come up with the longest word that starts with that letter. The user that picks the longest word first wins!

**Note**: An API key from [dictionaryapi.com](http://www.dictionaryapi.com/) is needed for work lookup. You will need to set the DICTIONARY_KEY environmental variable with your key

#### How To Play
- To start the game use the command `@botname play Longest Word`
- The bot will then announce the game has started and which letter it has chosen.
- Any player is free to submit as many words as they would like in the channel.
- The user that picks the longest word first wins! Ties go to the first user to enter a word of that length.

### Math
In this game, the bot will generate a random simple math problem. The first player to answer the problem correctly wins the round.

#### How To Play
- To start the game use the command `@botname play Math`
- The bot will ask how many rounds you wish to play. Anyone can answer.
- The bot will begin asking increasingly longer math questions.
- To answer, just say the correct number in the channel.
- The player with the most correct answers at then end of the rounds wins!

## Help
To get help from the bot, simply type `@botname help`.

To get help about a specific game, type `@botname help <game name>`

To get a list of games, type `@botname play`

To play a game, type `@botname play <game name>`

4. `npm start`

## config.js
The config file should be filled out as follows:

- slack:

### Configuration Environment Variables
You can set the configuration of the bot by using environment variables. _ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_=Default Value
- DICTIONARY_KEY=, An API key from [dictionaryapi.com](http://www.dictionaryapi.com/)
- SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-foo, Your Slack Token
- SLACK_AUTO_RECONNECT=true, Reconnect on disconnect

Set them using the `-e` flag while running docker:

## Creating Your Own Game
The `bot` was created in a way that makes adding your own games pretty easy.  Most of the communication with Slack is abstracted away from you, so all you have to worry about is the game logic and communicating with the player.  To create a new game, first create a new directory in `lib/games/` and add an `index.js`

`mkdir lib/games/my-new-game/ && touch lib/games/my-new-game/index.js`.

Each game is it's own class, the `bot` interface is expecting the following methods to be present:

The `constructor` is the method that is called when the game class is instantiated.  This method is a good spot to initialize your game (set up variables, state, etc).  The `bot` passes in three variables, `map` which contains a map of Slack ID's to users and channels.  This can be used later to look up a users information.  The `map` uses `.get(<some-id>)` to lookup user/channel details.  `bot` is all the information about the bot that instantiated the class such as the bot's name.  It also exposes a `message` method which can be used to push a message from your game out to Slack.  And lastly, the `logger` is an instance of a Winston wrapper that allows you to output debugging and logging info.

```
/**
 * Class constructor
 * @param  {object} map    Map of slack channels and user ids to info
 * @param  {object} bot    Information about the bot
 * @param  {Logger} logger Instance of logger utility
 */
constructor(map, bot, logger) {
  ...
}
```

Next up is the static `help` method, when a player types `@gamebot help <my-new-game-name>` the bot will run this method and reply with the help text.  This method takes one argument, `bot`, which is the information about the bot that is calling it.  Because the `help` method is static, the class hasn't been instantiated yet and the bot information wouldn't be available without passing it in here.

```
/**
 * Static method to return help message that explains how to play the game
 * @param {object} bot Slack bot information
 * @return {Promise}   A promise that resolves with a formatted help string
 */
static help(bot) {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve('My help text');
  });

  return promise;
}
```

On to the `start` method, this is what kicks off your game lifecycle.  This is called when a player types `@gamebot play <my-new-game-name>`.  The method takes an argument of `channel` which is information about the channel in which the game was started from.  Here's where you'd update the state of your app.  Two important things in this method are `this.game.end` and `this.game.error`.  The method (and most others) return promises that the bot uses to manage the state of a game.  When the game is finished, the `start` method should resolve it's promise using `this.game.end` which tells the bot that the game is over and tears down the instantiated class.  You can use `this.game.error` at any time your game is running and it experiences an error.

```
/**
 * Start game lifecycle
 * @param {string} channel The channel ID that started the game
 * @return {Promise}       A promise that will resolve when the game is finished
 */
start(channel) {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    this.game.end = resolve;
    this.game.error = reject;

    ...
  });
}
```

Next up is the heart of your game, the `handleMessage`.  This method is essentially your game loop.  When a message comes in to the bot from Slack, it dispatches it to any instantiated games.  Your game has to decide if it should respond to those messages.  The method takes a single argument of `message` which contains the message object received from Slack.  You can use things like `message.type` or `message.event` and the `message.text` to determine if your game needs to respond.  This method must return an Promise, if you need to send a message back you can pass text into your resolve and the bot will send a message to Slack.

```
/**
 * Handle incoming message
 * @param  {object} message Message object from Slack RTM api
 * @param  {object} user    User information
 * @param  {object} channel Channel information
 * @return {Promise}        A promise that resolves with an appropriate response
 */
handleMessage(message) {
  ...
}
```

And the last bit you need to add to the `index.js` is an export so the bot can include your game and configs.  Note that the `config.name` is what users will have to type to play.  The `config.unique.global` is used to deterine if there should only ever be one instance of your game running Slack wide.  If set to false, your game can be running in multiple channels.

```
module.exports = {
  config: {
    name: '<my-new-game-name>',
    unique: {
      global: true,
    },
  },
  Game: <my-new-class-name>,
};
```
